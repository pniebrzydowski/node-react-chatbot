# node-react-chatbot

## Supported Browsers

The application supports Google Chrome and Firefox latest versions, as well as IE11+ and Edge. It was primarily developed and tested in Chrome and is therefore optimized for it. 

## Configuration

The base URL for the server can be set within `frontend/config/index.js`. The default path is `http://localhost:8000`. The port for the backend can be changed in the server application root file at `backend/server.js`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

## Info

The frontend of the project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
